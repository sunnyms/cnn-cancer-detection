## General Information
- This Project is to build CNN Based multiclass classification Model which can accurately detect Cancer - melanoma.
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. We want to find a solution to minimise the death
- A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- 1st CNN model trained on limited number of Dataset was overfitting and was not useful
- 2nd CNN model was trained with Dropouts to rectify the overfitting which in turn reduced the accuracy and Model was underfitting 
- 3rd CNN model was created with help of data augmentation which expanded the Dataset and generalised the model.
- 3rd CNN model accuracy is calculated to approximately 78% which quite acceptable in predicting the Cancer.
